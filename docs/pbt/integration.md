# Downstream integration and acceptance

[Design index](../pbt-design-rfc.md)

These sections preserve their recorded implementation and acceptance history.
Case counts and commit identities belong to the named revision; current CI must
be checked separately. The finite laws retain their stated runtime premises.

## Proposed public surface

These are proposed signatures, not claims about the currently released API.
The typed entrypoints are in `clan/poo/testing/type`; generic execution is
owned by the directly imported `clan/poo/testing/property` modules above.

```scheme
(trace-generator command-type model steps: 64 dependencies: [])
(check-trace model commands with-system same?: equal?)
(trace-property model with-system same?: equal?)
(replay-counterexample report)

(property-action descriptor property consume
  sampler: #f dependencies: [])
```

`trace-generator` returns an ordinary `make-generator` object. Its descriptor is
`(List command-type)` and its `.accept?` additionally validates state-dependent
prefixes. Callers use that exact descriptor identity with `check-property`.
`trace-property` only turns `check-trace`'s explicit comparison result into the
Boolean required by the existing runner. `replay-property` retains seeded replay;
`replay-counterexample` executes the stored concrete witness without drawing or
shrinking it. `property-action` gains the same supplied-sampler/dependency inputs
as `check-property`, retaining the existing Reader/FUN chain.

The existing `Record` contract defines `TraceModel`; `TraceGenerator` inherits
that contract and adds generation/shrink hooks. Construct models with
`make-instance TraceGenerator`, retaining normal POO field initialization and
validation. No separate model interpreter or package namespace is introduced.

`Command`, `State`, `Result` and `Observation` are explicit Type descriptors.
The transition boundary validates dependent state/results and the comparison
boundary validates observations. Callable fields recognize procedures; they do
not infer host arity or termination, or preempt the shrinker's candidate gate.

The model exposes these extension points:

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `initial` | `() -> reference-state`; returns a fresh pure state |
| `enabled?` | `(state command) -> Boolean`; whether this prescribed operation is admissible now |
| `advance` | `(state command) -> (values next-state expected-result)`; pure, deterministic transition |
| `observe` | `(state) -> stable finite canonical observation` |
| `draw` | `(state random size) -> Option command`; `some` carries a command, `#f` ends the trace |
| `shrink` | `(command) -> finite proper list of parameter candidates` |
| `measure` | `(command) -> natural number`; parameter complexity |

A false command, when allowed by its Type, is `(some #f)`, not end-of-trace.
Hook exceptions are errors, not disabled commands. Non-Boolean preconditions or
comparisons are errors rather than truthy successes. Invalid command descriptors
or callback configuration refuse before actual fixture effects.

`with-system` is a scoped fixture function, `(use -> result)`. It creates a fresh
actual system, calls `use` once and owns cleanup through standard call-with/IO
mechanisms. The supplied system is an ordinary object exposing:

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `State` | Actual state descriptor, including any deliberately retired snapshots |
| `initial` | Initial actual state, validated through `State` |
| `step` | `(actual-state command) -> (values next-actual-state actual-result)` |
| `observe` | `(actual-state) -> owned/stable canonical observation` |

Construct the fixture with `make-instance (TraceSystem ActualState)`. The scoped
callback is used exactly once. Its result cannot be replaced or reused after the
scope ends.

Pure prefix admission and dependency retirement share one typed state fold;
selection chooses whether to reject or omit a disabled command. Generation and
differential checking use bounded state folds; checking exits at the first
mismatch. `property-action` composes the run and consumer through the existing
Reader/FUN bind rather than introducing an effects framework.

Logical handles resolve only in the fixture that created them. No pointer,
mutable PRNG, table owner or cached receipt may escape one trial and become the
initial state of another trial or shrink probe. Fixtures can own files or other
resources without making the PBT runner a resource manager.

## First complete collection adapter

Use typed data commands over integer keys/values and explicit logical ticket IDs.
The reference state contains primary bindings, logical metadata generation,
current/stale family status and captured before/after delta expectations.
It computes uniqueness independently with association lists.

| Operation | Required differential checks |
| --- | --- |
| Stage | Capture the old expectation and generation without publishing a table update |
| Install | Old-value validation, unique-index result and atomic primary/index observation |
| Undo | Existing inverse delta restores the prior observation or reports the prescribed conflict |
| Put/remove | Update reference bindings and every observed index; unblock a refused install when appropriate |
| Expire metadata | Leave the old collection state available only as a stale observation/control |
| Read old | Require the documented old-family refusal; no fallback to unchecked primary data |
| Refresh | Reconstruct through existing public index/table constructors, preserving valid primary content |
| Install old-generation ticket | Require stale delta refusal after refresh |
| Restage/retry | Create a fresh ticket; success must follow the same ordinary install path |

A deterministic valid prefix guarantees unique-index conflict, repair/retry,
old-value conflict, inverse restoration, stale family and stale delta rejection.
State-dependent random suffixes vary keys, values, pending-ticket selection and
revision order. Both RationalDict and the existing trie backend must agree with
the independent oracle. No new table, hash, index or ownership algorithm is part
of the test harness.

Inject known faulty adapters: admit a stale ticket, mutate primary state before
index refusal, lose an inverse update, or return a wrong index owner. The runner
must fail, shrink to a valid witness and reproduce it. Successful tests alone are
insufficient acceptance of the PBT implementation.

## Complex executable examples

[`collection-properties.md`](../collection-properties.md) explains three runnable
examples in `examples/collection-properties.ss`: interleaved unique-owner handoff,
two-round service upgrades with retained receipts, and same-epoch ABA versus
cross-epoch rejection. Each uses both backends and multiple seeded runs through
`property-action`, with random suffixes after its required domain prefix.

Known faulty adapters must produce smaller dependency-valid counterexamples and
reproduce them through both replay paths. Custom-prefix controls additionally
verify owned scalar commands and fresh producer selection from retained IDs,
rather than assuming that the trace step number is unused. The corresponding
`freshHandle_lower`, `freshHandle_gt` and `freshHandle_not_mem` laws extend the
existing Lean testing model. These are finite design controls, not universal
runtime correctness or serializability claims.

## Downstream Scheme integration

The library additions below are implemented on PR #13. Users need a revision
containing them; older releases must not be described as providing these exports. Declare the package through the
project's normal Gerbil dependency workflow, with no Lean checkout or special
load-path/environment variables.

The downstream project owns its command Type, pure model and scoped actual fixture.
The following proposed test file delegates generation, shrink budgets and replay
admission to Gerbil-POO, and execution/discovery to `:std/test`:

```scheme
(export collection-model-test)
(import :std/test :clan/poo/object :clan/poo/testing/type
        (only-in "support/collection-model.ss" Command model with-system))

;; One standard suite fails on mismatch, stale sources, exhaustion or callback error.
(def collection-model-test
  (test-suite "collection model"
    (test-case "stateful differential traces"
      (let* ((sampler (trace-generator Command model steps: 64))
             (descriptor (.get sampler descriptor))
             (property (trace-property model with-system))
             (report (check-property descriptor property sampler: sampler
                       dependencies: [model] seed: 41 cases: 100
                       size: 40 shrink-budget: 200)))
        (check-equal? (list (.get report status) (.get report counterexample)
                            (.get report cause))
                      '(passed #f #f))))))
```

If `with-system` captures mutable factory/adapter recipes, include those stable
recipe objects in `dependencies:` as well; do not include the fresh mutable
fixture itself. A downstream project can first adopt the supplied collection
example, then replace only its command Type, model and actual adapter.

Export suite names ending in `-test`, retain the project's standard build/test
entry (`gerbil build` / `gerbil test`), and use its existing process/heap guards.
No PBT-specific runner is required. The implementation example will expose the
same model/fixture to a normal suite and a Reader/FUN `property-action` consumer.

For an expected regression failure, call `check-trace` on the stored minimized
trace for step diagnostics and `replay-counterexample` to reproduce Boolean false
with current sources and a fresh fixture. `replay-property` reproduces the seeded
search. A library mismatch is a failed test; no test should accept `error` or
`stale` merely because it was expecting a counterexample.

## Lean proof and implementation placement

Extend the existing `LeanPoo.Functional.PropertyTesting` namespace, rather than
creating a parallel testing namespace. Keep executable Lean controls in top-level
`Examples/` and `Tests/`; keep Gerbil functions in `testing/type.ss` and the
collection adapter in a functionally named `examples/` file. Each `def` documents
its contract/failure boundary. Split by existing functional boundaries if needed;
no code file should grow beyond the agreed modularity limit.

Required finite source laws:

1. Enabled draw/advance preserves valid prefixes and the declared step bound.
2. Dependency retirement returns a valid ordered subsequence under pure,
   deterministic model transitions and command admission premises.
3. Accepted shrink steps retain validity and falsity and strictly decrease the
   natural measure, reusing the existing budget/preservation theorems.
4. Step simulation plus initial observation agreement implies finite-trace
   agreement, including the first prescribed refusal and unchanged-state cases.
5. Stale specification snapshots refuse replay; concrete witness replay does not
   require a PRNG stream equality assumption.

Faithful backend observations, equality, stable callbacks and actual adapter
refusal classification remain explicit assumptions. These proofs do not verify
Gerbil, C++, FFI memory safety, arbitrary callback termination or concurrent
linearizability. Performance acceptance is measured separately.

## Verification matrix

| Obligation | Implementation / executable evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Typed model and fixture data | `TraceModel`, inherited `TraceGenerator`, `TraceSystem`; examples declare one reusable fixture Record and create fresh instances |
| State-dependent draws and dependency repair | Shared typed `fold-trace`, bounded generator fold, existing shrink budget/domain gates; invalid-draw, false-command and independent-suffix controls |
| Fresh resource scope | Distinct fixture identity across trials, shrink probes and both replays; cleanup counters remain balanced after comparison exceptions |
| Canonical handoff | Exact normalized command identity, one normalization per check, contracted callbacks through repair/replay, and late rejection before fixture effects |
| First difference | Initial/result/state fault controls reject later steps and count only required observations |
| Adapter contracts | Malformed actual state, result and observation are Type errors, not counterexamples |
| Collection semantics | RationalDict and trie lifecycle plus stale-admission, index-owner, inverse and premature-publication fault injections |
| Finite Lean laws | `retire_valid`, `retire_sublist`, `retire_deletion`, `drawTrace_sound`, `trace_simulation`, `replayTrace_stale`, `replayTrace_failed` |
| Concrete collection proofs | Top-level `Examples/CollectionTesting.lean` reuses `applyIndexed` and `inverseChanges`; proves complete two-key enumeration and checks conflict/retry/inverse/old-value/stale outcomes, final primary/index restoration and detection of premature primary publication |
| Local full workflow | The complete 149-module workflow and linked paired collection benchmark pass under existing limits; The existing focused PBT cases plus the independent-library cases pass |
| Published baseline CI | Lean `7932410a339dadc7d3736e286cbc6750c689d220`: 17 successful checks; Gerbil `4be7c411120cce18436fc35875a62da8e420f16a`: 53 successful checks, including single-process acceptance |

The local full-workflow row records the earlier accepted workflow. In the
interrupted-shrink follow-up, macOS `just check 2 1 4` stopped at the existing
90-second `build-shared` executable-construction gate. That is an unpassed local
build gate, not a falsified property or a paired-performance receipt. The existing
standard build configuration and limits are retained. Standalone kernel tests,
Record/FUN regressions, complete compiled-suite execution and exact-head CI are
reported separately; none substitutes for a missing full-entry receipt.

The published baseline CI was checked before this follow-up. Every later revision
must pass the same CI; that baseline is not evidence for unsubmitted edits. Full
Lean submission checks and exact-head remote CI remain separate from target proof
checks. No source law proves a host adapter simulation premise automatically.

The three delayed Gerbil baseline jobs were waiting in GitHub artifact download,
not running a failing compiler/test. They completed without reruns or changed
limits. Local `pkg-config-libs "openssl"` uses the selected system `pkg-config`;
the Nix tool without OpenSSL metadata is distinct from Homebrew's configured tool.
No library paths are hard-coded to hide that environment distinction.

## Acceptance checklist

- [x] Reusable trace generation/admission, with typed invalid-draw and bound controls.
- [x] Fresh-fixture initial/step/result/state comparison and first-divergence reports.
- [x] Dependency-retiring structural and parameter shrinking; independent suffix retention.
- [x] Original-cause errors, expected refusal and specification-vs-fixture stale controls.
- [x] Seed and concrete-witness replay; old-source refusal before fixture effects.
- [x] Complete indexed collection lifecycle on two backends, including failure/retry.
- [x] Fault injection demonstrates false witnesses, valid shrinking and exact reproduction.
- [x] Standard downstream test example and FUN/IO composition, using the implemented public API.
- [x] Finite Lean laws and executable examples, with assumptions stated beside claims.
- [x] Focused regressions, the COMPLETE Scheme inventory and COMPLETE Lean checks pass.
- [x] Published baseline commits in both PRs have separately verified full CI results; later revisions retain the same required gate.
- [x] Resource limits, existing checks and progress remain; no SubAgent or committed raw datasets.

The finite V1 protocol is complete within the stated scope. Keep universal
correctness claims separate from generated evidence, and verify each submitted
revision through the unchanged full gates. The matrix identifies reproducible
checks; it does not turn this document into a replacement for their results.
