# Persistent prototype maps and guarded slot layouts

This implements the representation protocol acceptance target from TODO.md. The
Racket paper's “Different instance representation” uses balanced maps and delayed
sharing; “Same instance representation, different prototype representation” makes
explicit slot specifications compatible with the same final-self semantics.
Shape sharing, vector offsets and inline sites advance the implementation ideas
in the original representation TODO; they are not a new claim of a complete MOP.

## Protocol and public operations

`prototype-map.ss` uses V19 `std/struct/rbtree`, not a second tree implementation.
It stores ordered contributions and a first-name index. Persistent updates copy
balanced-tree paths, preserve later same-name methods and append new names. Input
and reflection list spines/entry pairs are owned; values and SlotSpecs are shared.
`prototype-map-remove` removes all direct contributions for a name, rebuilding the
order tree. There is no logarithmic removal or deep-value immutability claim.

The actual `object.ss` constructor, defaults, setters, `.putslot!`, `.putdefault!`
and `.cc` use these snapshots. `.cc` shares unaffected tree paths and rebinds
formulas to the new receiver; it does not retain an evaluated parent instance.
`.removeslot!` and `.removedefault!` expose inherited contributions again.

`slot-layout.ss` weakly interns a sorted unique symbolic shape. Symbol identities,
including uninterned names, determine its process-local order. No serial number
is a disk format or cross-process identity. Each live shape shares its name/index
mapping; each receiver owns its vector cells. Ordinary lookup retains the existing
hash interface. The vector is prepared only by an explicit `object-layout` or
`.ref/inline` access, and successful ordinary reads keep it coherent. This is an
opt-in representation protocol, not a claim that every hash instance was replaced.

A caller creates `make-slot-cache 'total`, then uses `.ref/inline receiver site`.
The site retains one owner, revision, layout and certified index, never a separate
cached result. Every hit requires exact owner/revision/layout identity. Equal
shapes on distinct receivers cannot share cells. Supported parent, protocol,
declaration, slot, default, topology and instance edits invalidate existing values,
compiled methods, ordering, reflection AND layout through the same registered
reverse-dependency closure. A diamond advances each affected owner once. Failed
preflight changes neither snapshots nor guards. Missing slots/errors never install
a successful index; present false remains a real value. An ABA value/shape change
still rejects the previous generation. Removal of a method does not erase an
explicit instance assignment; these are separate existing protocols.

## Integrated acceptance

`t/representation-test.ss` exercises persistent snapshots, duplicate method order,
uninterned symbols, live shape sharing, receiver switching, shared-parent diamonds,
computed values, insert/delete/default/topology changes, failed edits, cycles and
retry. `examples/representation-service.ss` composes checked ObjectContract/refine
with existing Reader/FUN bind and a reusable total access site. Every invocation
still validates the candidate; a layout hit does not substitute for admission.

Lean `Prototype/Representation.lean` proves first-write/frame/removal laws, current
index observations, owner/revision/layout rejection, present-false behavior and
connects stale-revision rejection to existing finite graph invalidation. Executable
controls live in top-level `Examples/Representation.lean`.

The proofs model source-level behavior. They do not verify the RBTree library,
weak table, collector, compiler or physical vector implementation. Token identity
must denote a fixed shape and receiver-local cells. All dependencies must be
registered; supported edits/evaluation are serialized. Raw generated struct setters,
raw instance-hash mutations and unregistered callback dependencies bypass the
protocol. No host process termination, concurrent atomicity, retained-function
revocation or speed/allocation improvement is claimed.

## Remaining optimization ideas

This closes the mapping/layout/invalidation protocol, not every speculative
performance idea in the historical TODO. Small-map specialization, Patricia trees,
frequency sorting, automatic JIT/PIC selection, full hash removal and compiler
constant-folding qualification remain unimplemented. Matched complete-workflow
benchmarks are required before claiming any strategy is faster.
